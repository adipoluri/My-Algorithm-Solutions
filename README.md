# My-Algorithm-Solutions
I created this repository with hopes to publish the algorithms I have created. I want to keep them here for future use aswell as possibly using this repo as a teaching resource. In the end, I probably will use this repo to store my learning so I can come back in the future to see how much I have grown.

## Algorithms:

- **Magic Sum Solver**: Takes an int width and returns a solution to the magic sum square of that width

# My-Algorithm-Solutions
I created this repository with hopes to publish the algorithms I have created. I want to keep them here for future use aswell as possibly using this repo as a teaching resource. In the end, I probably will use this repo to store my learning so I can come back in the future to see how much I have grown.

## Algorithms:

- **Magic Sum Solver**: Takes an int width and returns a solution to the magic sum square of that width
- **Mosaic Maker**: An Image Proccessing algorithm that turns an image into a mosaic of multiple images. Uses KD-tree nearest neighbour search for optimization
- **Painter Application**: A small painter app made during an interview with a company
- **Dome Creator**: Dividie and Conquer Convex Hull algorithm for my algorithms course problem set
- **K-means Image Compression**: A small compression algorithm using K-means clustering
- **Dict Client**: A Dictionary Client impleminting the DICT protocol
- **DNS Server**: A DNS CUI like dig
- **POP3 Server**: Implementation for the POP3 Protocol according to RFC 1939
